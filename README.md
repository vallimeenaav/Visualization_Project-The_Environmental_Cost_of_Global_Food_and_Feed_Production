## 📌 Project Overview

🌱 What is this project about?

Food production is essential to sustain the world’s growing population, but it also comes at a significant environmental cost. This project analyzes:

✅ Global food vs. feed production trends

✅ Carbon footprint of food production & emissions

✅ Impact of agriculture on climate change & temperature variations

✅ Geographic production trends & land usage patterns

We combine data visualization, statistical insights, and climate analysis to explore how food production affects the planet and how we can move toward sustainable solutions.

## 📊 Key Sections & Visualizations

### 1️⃣ Introduction: The Problem Statement

1. Food & feed production is a major driver of climate change.
2. The agriculture sector contributes 25-30% of total CO₂ emissions.
3. This project explores production trends, emissions, and climate impact to identify sustainable solutions.

### 2️⃣ Global Food & Feed Production Trends

1. Food production has tripled over the past 50 years, whereas feed production has only doubled.
2. China, the U.S., and India are the biggest contributors.
3. Most commonly produced items: cereals, vegetables, dairy, and meat.

🔹 Key Insight: The demand for food is growing faster than feed production, affecting sustainability.

### 3️⃣ CO₂ Emissions from Food Production

1. Animal-based foods contribute the most to CO₂ emissions.
2. Beef production has the highest carbon footprint, followed by cheese, lamb, and farmed shrimp.
3. The farm stage accounts for the majority of emissions, followed by processing & transport.

🔹 Key Insight: Reducing red meat consumption and improving agriculture efficiency can significantly reduce emissions.

### 4️⃣ Land Usage & Food Sustainability

1. Beef requires the highest land area (16.3 m² per kg).
2. Dark chocolate & dairy products also have high land footprints.
3. Plant-based foods tend to have lower CO₂ emissions but vary in land usage.

🔹 Key Insight: Deforestation & land use for food production are major sustainability challenges.
